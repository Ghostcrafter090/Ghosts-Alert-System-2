Ghost's Alert System is the backend API used for generating and distributing Severe Weather Alerts based on the L system. The L system is a storm classification system developed by GS (Ghost Spectora & Associates), it was needed to provide a technical easy to understand class that every possible low pressure system could be classified under. A system that is both robust and accurate, as well as expandable due to the inevitable rise of climate change and global intensification of most storms.
